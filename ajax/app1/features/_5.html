  <h2>The Feed</h2>	
	
  <p>
	Parrot is much more than a match-maker. We take the next logical step forward by providing a feed to engage with matches outside of the messenger. Dating apps on today's market limit users by only allowing the chat as the channel for communication. We took learnings from social media to allow users to post content to Parrot for direct engagement from their matches, such as emoji reactions to photos/posts and upvotes. This solves the pain point of having to craft the first message.
