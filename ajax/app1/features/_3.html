  <h2>Browse & Chirp Users</h2>	
	
  <p>
    We validate interest by allowing users to "chirp" one another. A "chirp" is an anonymous match request you can send to a user, in the same way one adds someone as a friend on Facebook, or follows another on Instagram. If a user chirps you back, it's a match!
      <br><br>
      There are 5 unique ways of chirping users and none of them include swiping:  </p>
      <ul>
          <li> Browse & Chirp through University group pages</li>
          <li> Browse & Chirp through "Flocks" group pages</li>
          <li> Search specifically for a crush and chirp</li>
          <li> Chirp users detected within plain sight (300 feet)</li>
          <li> Chirp users from phone contacts</li>
    </ul>
